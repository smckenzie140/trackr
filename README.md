# WIP

At this point this is a very simple rails project intended for learning.

So far everything that has been done is through the rails scaffold command to provide a basis for working together.

Commands run to start
`rails new trackr`
`rails g scaffold card title body:text`
`rails g scaffold board title`
`rails g scaffold state title`
